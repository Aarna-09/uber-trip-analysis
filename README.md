# 🚖 Uber Trip Analysis

A data analysis project that explores Uber trip data to uncover insights into ride patterns, demand trends, and operational metrics using Python and data visualization libraries.

---

## 📊 Objective

The goal of this project is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on Uber trip data to:

- Understand trip frequency and distribution
- Identify peak hours, days, and months
- Analyze pickup and drop-off patterns
- Gain business insights from time-based trends

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** – Basic plotting
- **Seaborn** – Advanced data visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development and presentation

---

## 📌 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time-based aggregation (hours, days, months)
- Ride volume heatmaps and bar charts
- Identification of high-demand periods
- Business interpretation of trends

---

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

- **Hourly Analysis**: Found peak trip hours and idle times.
- **Daily Analysis**: Determined which days had the highest trip volume.
- **Monthly Patterns**: Observed demand shifts across different months.
- **Heatmap of Trips**: Used pivot tables to visualize ride density across hours and days.
